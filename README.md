# Discord Bot with OpenAI GPT-3 Integration
This Discord bot integrates with the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to answer questions that start with a question mark ("?"). 
It generates responses based on the provided question and sends them back to the user.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use this bot, you'll need the following:
Discord API Token - Replace <DISCORD_TOKEN> with your Discord bot token.
OpenAI API Key - Replace <API_KEY> with your OpenAI API key.

## Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Install the required Python packages:
pip install discord openai
Replace the placeholders in the code with your Discord API token and OpenAI API key:
openai.api_key = "<API_KEY>"
client.run("<DISCORD_TOKEN>")

## Usage
Invite the bot to your Discord server.
Start the bot by running the Python script:
python bot.py
In your Discord server, send a message starting with "?" to trigger the bot to answer your question using the GPT-3 model.

## Configuration
You can customize the bot's behavior by adjusting the following parameters in the code:
model_engine: Change the OpenAI GPT-3 engine if needed.
max_tokens: Set the maximum number of tokens in the response.
temperature: Adjust the temperature for response randomness.
